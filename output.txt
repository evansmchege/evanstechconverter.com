15 (By calculus) Write down E = || Az — bj? as a sum of four squares—the last one
is (C + 4D — 20)?. Find the derivative equations JE/9C = 0 and 9E/dD = 0.
Divide by 2 to obtain the normal equations AT AZ = Ab.

16 Find the height C of the best horizontal line to fit b = (0,8,8,20). An exact fit
‘would solve the unsolvable equations C' = 0, C = 8, C = 8, C = 20. Find the
4 by 1 matrix A in these equations and solve AT AZ = ATb. Draw the horizontal
line at height & = C and the four errors in e.

17 Project b = (0,8,8, 20) onto the line through a = (1,1,1,1). Find 7 = a"b/a"a
and the projection p = Fa. Check that e = b — p is perpendicular to a, and find the
shortest distance [ el] from b to the line through a.

18 Find the closest line b = Dt, through the origin, to the same four points. An exact
fit would solve D +0 = 0,D +1 =8,D-3 = 8D -4 = 20. Find the 4 by 1
‘matrix and solve AT AZ = ATb. Redraw Figure I1.3a showing the best line b = Dt.

19 Project b = (0,8,8,20) onto the line through a = (0,1,3,4). Find # = D and
p = Fa. The best C in Problem 16 and the best D in Problem 18 do not,
agree with the best (C, D) in Problems 11-14. That is because the two columns
(1,1,1,1) and (0, 1,3, 4) are perpendicular.

20 For the closest parabola b = C + Dt + Ft? to the same four points, write down the
unsolvable equations Az = b in three unknowns z = (C, D, E). Set up the three
normal equations AT AZ = ATb (solution not required). In Figure I1.3a you are now
fitting a parabola to 4 points—what is happening in Figure 11.3?

21 For the closest cubic b= C + Dt + Ef? ++ Ft* to the same four points, write down
the four equations Az = b. Solve them by elimination. In Figure I13a this cubic
now goes exactly through the points. What are p and e? .

22 The averages of the t, and b; are = 2 and b = 9. Verify that C + Df = b. Explain!

(a) Verify that the best line goes through the center point (£,5) = (2,9).
(b) Explain why C + DE =F comes from the first equation in ATAZ = ATb.
